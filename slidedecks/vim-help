  ► Windows, Buffers and Help
    • Here is what Vim's online help says:

      Summary:
        A buffer is the in-memory text of a file.
        A window is a viewport on a buffer.
        A tab page is a collection of windows.

    • You can have multiple windows open within Vim in a single terminal
    • Vim's online help is just a readonly file in its own Windows
# vim: filetype=slide

  ► Opening Vim Windows
    • Use ":new" to create a split with an empty buffer (do that now)
    • Use "ctrl-w, ctrl-w" to move between this window and the other
    • With the cursor in the other window, close it with ":q!"
    • "ctrl-w, n" does the same thing as ":new" if you prefer
    • Use ":split filename" to open (or create) "filename" in a new window
# vim: filetype=slide
#-
  ► Veritcal splits work too
      • Use ":vsplit"

    - Navigating between windows
